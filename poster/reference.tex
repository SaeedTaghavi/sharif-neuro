The fact that signals often take physiologically significant time to reach their destinations is fundamental to the design of neuronal networks. Thus, \textbf{time-delays} are essential because neuronal networks have finite signal transmission speed. In the next step we are going to include the effects of interaction time delay to our model. \\ \\
In computational models used for developing and optimizing stimulation techniques, one should take into account spike timing-dependent plasticity (\textbf{STDP}), a fundamental property of neuronal tissue, according to which synaptic weights depend on the neuronal firing pattern. \ \ \  \\
 %It was shown experimentally that synaptic plasticity enhances neuronal synchronization. From the kindling phenomenon, in the context of epilepsy, where preparatory stimulation induces the spontaneous production of epileptic seizures, it is well known that neural networks may learn pathologically strong synaptic interactions. The novel desynchronizing stimulation protocols are designed to invert this pathological process via anti-kindling. The very goal is to stimulate in a way that the formerly affected neuronal populations unlearn their pathological connectivity and, hence, their tendency to produce pathological synchronization, where the physiological neuronal activity is re-established on a long-term basis.
