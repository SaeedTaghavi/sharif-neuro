%Which properties of a molecule define its odor? This is a basic question of olfaction, 
%yet to be answered. 
Human olfactory system has a repertoire of about 350 olfactory receptors. 
Molecules bind to them with different affinities and activate them with different efficacies, 
resulting in a combinatorial code that identifies odorants. 
We hypothesized that the binding affinity between a pair of odorant-receptor is affected by their relative sizes. 
The affinity can reaches its maximum if molecular volume of an odorant matches volume of a receptor's binding-pocket 
and it reach zero if the sizes are too different, 
obscuring the effect of other molecular properties. 
We formulated this hypothesis mathematically and verified it on experimental data.
%and predicted the volume and the structural flexibility of each receptor's binding-site, 
%which are significantly different among receptors. 
%This provides a reason for differences in smell among similar molecules of different sizes.
